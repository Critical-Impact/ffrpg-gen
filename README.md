### About

This is a character generator that I have been working on for the Returners FFRPG 2ND edition system.
It is built using a combination of django and ember JS. The django side handles data storage, authentication and provides a REST API for the client side to access.
The ember side has an interface for creating both characters and monsters.

There is multi-classing functionality built in. This may or may not be removed as it is an unoffical modification
